Though I do not pretend, by this little treatise, to make any person a perfect master of Country-dancing, yet, with the help of these my instructions, and their taking some opportunities of going into company, and by the assistance of a good partner, begin with some easy dances, by which any one, having a good ear to music, may very soon become a proficient.

—A. D. Dancing Master
#+END_QUOTE

This is neither a period book nor a scholarly one—for the first, turn to one of the many treatises by 18th-century dancing masters; for the second, academia already has you covered.

Instead, this is intended as a crash course to get late 18th- and early 19th-century reenactors with minimal country dancing experience prepared for a Saturday evening dance. Its first goal is to be practical; a secondary goal is to be historically-defensible. Anyone who claims to do truly historically /correct/ dancing is lying: sources are simply too scarce, and those that exist are too open to interpretation.  But even if perfection is unattainable, it's still worth avoiding what's obviously not right, and there are a lot of fun discoveries to be made in pursuing the sources we have and doing the dancing as well as we can.

What follows is the result of my time with a few dance treatises, more than a few books of dance music, various other primary sources, and dozens of country dances as a dancer, musician, dancing master, the least-experienced person in the room trying to figure out what's even going on, and the most-experienced person in the room trying to make things more fun for others.

** A few disclaimers

- Footnotes to real sources have been added where possible, but there is bound to be some amount of Tim Making Things Up. Also, this document deals indiscriminately with country dancing (and the Scotch Reel) from approximately 1750-1820 in the Highlands of Scotland, the Lowlands of Scotland, urban England, and colonial America. Please don't leave with the impression that dancing was the same at all times in all places; it's just that elaborating on regional and temporal variations (apart from a few examples) is out of scope.

- I have no formal medical training. Suggestions below are based on things I and others do regularly, but if a movement or position causes you serious pain please don't do it, and if you have a pre-existing injury or condition please consult with experts and only attempt things that seem responsible.

- I will be using ``man" and ``woman" to indicate the people dancing particular roles. They are /temporary roles/, and not meant to be an indication of anything larger. In the period, dances were sometimes done entirely by men or entirely by women[fn::Wilson, 5]. Every treatise I've read uses gendered terms that assume male/female partners, and it seems a little unhelpful for this book to use seemingly-gender-neutral terms that map directly to the "man" or "woman" you'd see in the treatise. Please dance whichever role you'd like and with whichever consenting partner you'd like, regardless of the gender terminology used.

* Position and Posture
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/Position/ is the foundation, or basis, upon which the principles of the art of Dancing are founded; for without good position, action, however animated it may be, can neer thoroughly please.

—Francis Peacock[fn::Peacock, 67-68]
#+END_QUOTE

Dancing is frequently defined as ``moving to music", but  there is much to be said for looking the part even when /not/ moving. A room full of people slouching looks disheveled; a room full of people standing like dancers looks like an Event.

Similarly, all movement is designed to come from someone in the position of a dancer and can look especially incongrous otherwise.

Finally, good dance position helps prevent minor pains and more serious injuries (though you may be a little tight or have weak core muscles at first).

** Standing

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/The position of a Soldier without Arms/

He is to stand straight and firm upon his legs […] the toes turned out; the belly drawn in a little, but without constraint; the breast a little projected; the shoulders square to the front, and kept back

—Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben[fn::von Steuben, 10-11]
#+END_QUOTE

There is quite a bit of overlap between the position of a period country dancer, the position of a period soldier, and the position of a modern ballet dancer. All emphasize a straight back and open hips (which does /not/ mean pulling your shoulders back and sticking out your belly); the most significant distinction is the position of the feet and arms, which are less important and will be addressed later.

To open their hips, some people imagine putting headlights on their pelvis and then standing so that the headlights shine parallel to the ground, not down into it (it will feel like you're rotating your pelvis up to bring the beams of light up). Others think of ``zipping up" the stomach—pulling up on the front of the pelvis and tightening the butt muscles. Others speak of ``avoiding Donald Duck butt" or ``leading with the chest". Whatever the method, your vertebrae should end up stacked on top of each other, your shoulders should be above your hips, and the area below the belt should feel…slightly exposed.

This established, it's then easy to have good turnout. Turnout comes not from the knees (twisting the knees will wreck them) but from the hips. Opening up the hips as above lets each leg rotate out in its entirety; your heels will naturally come to the center and your toes will naturally point more to the side. Having good turnout and ``being a flexible person" are mostly unrelated[fn::I personally have been gifted with excellent turnout and yet can't touch my toes or straighten my back when sitting on the floor.]; achieving turnout is more about technique than having lengthened muscles. Don't worry about exactly what angle your feet make; 90° is great. Ballet dancers can do 180°, but we're not doing ballet.

The position of a standing dancer, then, is standing up straight, having good turnout, letting the heels touch each other and the feet form a 90° angle, and letting the arms rest loosely at one's sides (the elbows with a natural bend).

** Moving

The specifics of footwork will be addressed below, but all propulsion should maintain turnout. When taking a step lead with the toe and let the toe strike the ground first. At sufficient speeds the heels may never even hit the ground. This is similar to the Prussian step, with its feet reaching out over the ground to glide over it, but…dancier.

* Traveling Steps
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I would recommend the use of the most simple and neatly constructed steps in this kind of dancing:
practice will enable the dancer to perform them in that correct, light, and prompt manner, which
the nature of the music requires.

—Barclay Dun[fn::Dun, 19-20]
#+END_QUOTE

One of the biggest differences between period dancing and modern English country dancing is simply how one moves. In the period, nobody walked. The single biggest improvement reenactors could make to their dancing is by using a dance step to move around!

** In two or four
Most dancing is in reel time, which in the 18th century was either 2/2 or 6/8. Surprisingly, only the details change between the two: the general idea is the same in either meter. The below steps also apply to strathspeys (which are in 4/4[fn::Macdonald] and slower), but strathspeys are less likely to be found in the wild[fn::Though native to and common in the Scottish Highlands, they seem to have only been briefly popular among non-Highlanders at the end of the 18th century].

*** Skipping[fn::AD, 14]
The most basic option. You can call it as "right-hop-left-hop".

1. With your weight on your left leg, reach out with your right foot (toe pointed![fn::Dun, 27] Turnout maintained!) and step onto it.
2. Hop forward on your right foot.
3. With your weight now on your /right/ leg, reach out with your left foot and step onto it.
4. Hop forward on your left foot.

Repeat as needed. Each cycle (#1-4) occupies one bar of music, or two beats (with the beats falling on #1 and #3).

*** Skip-change-of-step (kemshóole[fn::Peacock, 91])
A slightly fancier way of getting around. I like to call it out as ``step-close-step-hop". To wit:

1. With your weight on your left leg, reach out with your right foot (toe pointed! Turnout maintained!) and step onto it.
2. Slide the left foot in behind the right foot (ideally with the left foot's instep touching the right foot's heel: third position) and transfer weight onto the left foot.
3. Reach out with your right foot again, as in step #1.
4. Hop forward on the right foot, /meanwhile/ pull the left leg through, ready for the /left/ foot to reach out.

The process then repeats with the sides switched. Note that when skipping you get both the right and the left with one bar of music, but with skip-change of step just one side fills the whole bar and you need a second bar to do the other side.

Teaching it can be tricky. The key element of the step is handling momentum on step #4: pulling one leg through in a continuous motion and using its weight and your forward motion to effect a hop on the other foot. Therefore, doing it slowly doesn't really translate to doing it at speed since the momentum is all out of whack.

Instead, I have dancers start by doing a elementary-school-style gallop in a circle—leading with the right foot and always bringing the left foot up behind it. Once everyone's galloping I have them switch to leading with the left foot.  Then I have them do eight gallops on the right followed by eight on the left, then four and four, then two and two and two and two. Alternating by two is equivalent to the desired dance step; all that's left is fine-tuning the footwork (pointed toes! Good turnout! Closing in third position!).

*** Peacock's variation
Francis Peacock suggests that one ``may introduce a very lively" variation by, effectively, galloping by four and four instead of by two and two. When dancing it does make a surprisingly big difference, both to the dancer and to the observers!

*** Slip Stepping
If you imagine ``galloping to the side" you probably have it right.

Slightly more technically, stand on your toes, move your first leg out and transfer weight to it, then move your second leg until your heels touch. Use the impact of the heels touching to kick your first leg back out, and repeat ad nauseum.

** In three (quicktime)
Shockingly, there are a number of period dances in three (almost always 9/8) and, as far as I know, zero explanations of the relevant footwork. The folk tradition has two candidates. Both are based on skip-change-of-step as explained above, but need to have six bits instead of four bits to work in the new meter. Choose your favorite; it doesn't really matter which one you do.

*** Skip-change-of-step, always leading with the right

1. #1 as above
2. #2 as above
3. #3 as above
4. #4 as above
5. Reach out with your left foot and step onto it.
6. Pull the right leg through /while/ hopping on the left foot, ready for #1 (again with the right!)

*** Skip-change-of-step, alternating
1. #1 as above (that is, as it would be in two)
2. #2 as above
3. #1 again as above
4. #2 again as above
5. #3 as above
6. #4 as above, ready to repeat with sides switched.

In other words, steps 1 and 2 are repeated before continuing on as normal.

I have only ever taught these by demonstrating, explaining the basics in words, and then playing 9/8 music for several minutes while letting people roam around the dance floor working it out on their own. There may be a better way of doing this, but that's for you to figure out. It certainly shouldn't be attempted until people are very confident doing it in 2.
* Setting Steps

Setting (also known as ``footing it") is where individual creativity can best shine. As far as I can tell there are no real rules to doing it right; one simply bops around to the allotted music while staying in roughly the same spot on the floor. Peacock lists quite a few options for setting and concludes with: ``I shall only add, that you have it in your power to change, divide, add to, or invert, the different steps described, in whatever way you think best adapted to the tune, or most pleasing to yourself"[fn::Peacock, 98].

Unless you're dancing the Scotch Reel, it is likely that you will only have occasion to set for two bars of music at a time. The below options can fill those two bars. There are more complex options—some that require more bars of music, and some that are just plain hard. I leave them all for another time.

** The cop-out
I call this as ``right-left-right <silence> left-right-left"

1. Step onto the right foot
2. Step onto the left foot
3. Step onto the right foot
4. Pause, with your left foot suspended in the air

Then repeat with the sides switched. For bonus points, try to land on your toes, point your toes, and generally look light on your feet.

** The pas de basque[fn::I'm unfortunately still looking for a source here...caveat lector]
This is a classier version of the cop-out.

1. Step onto the right foot
2. Bring the toe of the left foot next to the instep of the right foot, pushing down on the left foot to get the right foot a little off the ground (i.e., transferring weight)
3. Transfer weight back to the right foot, letting the left foot come off the ground (toes pointed!)
4. Pause, with your left foot in the air. For extra style points, add a /jeté/: straighten the left knee such that your left foot extends out over the ground diagonally to your front-left.

Then repeat with the sides switched.

** The back-step[fn::AD, 14] (minor kemkóssy[fn::Peacock, 92])
1. Put your right foot /behind/ your left one
2. Hop forward on your right foot as you swing your left leg out, ready to
3. Put your left foot behind your right one
4. Hop forward on the left foot, swinging the right foot around

Those four steps occupy two bars of music, so do /not/ repeat.

Be careful to stay in the same spot on the floor; it's easy to drift backwards[fn::AD, 14].

** Other options

- Peacock has a number of fancier options, most of which are Quite Scottish and also Very Athletic. I may put them in here at some point, but I do think that if you're ready for them you're ready to just read Peacock.

- Please let me know if you have found juicy options elsewhere.

* Terminology

- *Set:* A group of people dancing together, and the formation in which they stand. With enough people there may be multiple sets spread throughout the room.
- *Top (or head) of the set*: The part of the set closest to the band
- *Bottom (or foot) of the set*: The part of the set farthest from the band
- *Up*: Towards the top of the set
- *Down*: Towards the bottom of the set
- *Center line*: An imaginary line going through the center of the set from top to bottom
- *In*: Towards the center line
- *Out*: Away from the center line
- *Up and down the set*: In a line parallel to the center line
- *Across the set*: In a line perpendicular to the center line
- *Sideline*: Where everyone of the same gender starts
- *Minor set*: A portion of the set that's doing an iteration of the dance together. In a three-couple dance, this is a group of three couples (even if the entire set has twenty couples).
- *Active (or first) couple*: The couple that starts at the top of a minor set and tends to play the most involved role in the dance. Also called the *ones*.
- *Supporting couples*: The couples in a minor set that are not the active couple. They still dance, though!
- *Second couple*: The couple that comes after the first couple. Also called the *twos*.
- *Third, fourth, etc. couple*: c.f. ``second couple".
- *First, second, third, etc. place* The spot on the floor initially occupied by the first (or whichever) couple. As the dance continues, the second couple may, for example, end up in first place, so it can be helpful to refer to things in terms of geography instead of people.
- *Out (or neutral[fn::As Thomas Wilson calls them]) couples*: Couples not currently included in a minor set, who aren't dancing a particular iteration of the dance. They will dance later, though!
- *Neighbor*: The person next to you. For the first man, it's the second man. In a three-couple set, the second (wo)man has two neighbors: the first and third (wo)men.
- *First corner*: The person (dancing as the opposite gender) across and to the right from you. By convention this assumes that the ones are in second place. So the first man's first corner is the third woman (and vice versa) and the first woman's first corner is the second man. You might prefer to think of this as ``your first corner is the opposite-gendered person you find along the *first diagonal*".
- *Second corner*: c.f. *first corner*, but to the /left/, not the /right/. So the first man's second corner is the second woman and the first woman's second corner is the third man. Also c.f. *second diagonal*.
- *First diagonal*: A diagonal line extending from first place on the men's side to the last place on the women's side.
- *Second diagonal*: A diagonal line extending from first place on the women's side to last place on the men's side.

* Progression

In most cases, a dance will be done 6 or 8 or 100 times in a row, with individual people playing different roles each time through. ``Progression" refers to the mechanics of getting people in place to dance a different role the next time through.

** Most of the Time (Longways Sets)

The standard formula is to have a line of men facing a line of their female partners. Progression can induce a lot of stress and chaos, so I encourage you to remember these maxims:

- *Active couples remain active until they reach the bottom of the set*
- *Supporting couples remain supporting until they reach the top of the set*
- *Active couples move down by one each time through the dance*
- *Supporting couples move up by one each time through the dance*
- *Your role changes when you reach the top or bottom of the set*

Most period dances are for three couples ("triple minors") but you may find yourself dancing a duple minor and their progression is a little easier to understand, so let's start with that. For both of these scenarios, read them slowly and try to really think through why things are the way they are—don't just let your eyes glaze over the letters while you chuckle and nod.

*** Two-Couple Progression

Imagine that you have a six-couple set, with couples A, B, C, D, E, and F.

**** First iteration
A and B dance together. The other four couples are out. Everyone ends in the order B, A, C, D, E, F.

**** Second iteration
*Active couples remain active*, so A dances with their supporting couple, C. Everyone else is out, including B. The dance ends B, C, A, D, E, F.

**** Third iteration
*Supporting couples remain supporting*, so C is still a supporting couple. Meanwhile, B has reached the top, so their *role changes* to being active. Therefore, B and C dance together. Meanwhile, *active couples remain active*, so A dances with D. Note that E and F are /still/ sitting out. The dance ends C, B, D, A, E, F.

**** Fourth iteration
*Active couples remain active* and that includes B, so they dance with D. A dances with E. C and F are out. It ends C, D, B, E, A, F.

**** Fifth iteration
Sit down and think about this, and try not to cheat. Who dances with who? Who is out? What order do they end in?

C becomes active and dances with D. B remains active and dances with E. A remains active and dances with F. Everyone ends D, C, E, B, F, A.

**** Sixth iteration
A has been active, but is out of people to dance with…so they're out! C dances with E; B dances with F. They end D, E, C, F, B, A.

**** Seventh iteration
A and D, having reached the bottom/top, *change roles*. D becomes active and dances with E. C is with F. B dances with A, who is now the supporting couple. They end E, D, F, C, A, B.

**** More iterations
The logic is the same, but the order is thus (brackets indicate minor sets):
| At the start of the _____ iteration | The order is:    |
|---------------------------------+------------------|
| 8th                             | E, [D, F], [C, A], B |
| 9th                             | [E, F], [D, A], [C, B] |
| 10th                            | F, [E, A], [D, B], C |
| 11th                            | [F, A], [E, B], [D, C] |
| 12th                            | A, [F, B], [E, C], D |
| 13th                            | [A, B], [F, C], [E, D] |

And so on and so forth. The dance continues until the music stops!

**** A Note
If you have done modern country dancing, this is /not/ the same progression! The period way is to start with a single active couple and leave everyone out until that original couple reaches them. The modern way is to start with many active couples (in this case, A, C, and E would have all started as actives). So couples at the bottom of the set get a nice break where they can catch their breath or chat or whatever. It can be nice to have a breather! I believe this is also why some dances lasted over an hour[fn::Wilson, 5 and many other sources]; if you had fifty couples in the dance[fn::Wilson, 5] it could take rather a while for the bottom ones to even start moving.

*** Three-Couple Progression

Now imagine that that a six-couple set is dancing a triple minor dance.

**** First iteration
A, B, and C dance together. A is the active couple, both B and C are supporting. Since B comes after the active couple they are also known as the ``second couple", and similarly C is the ``third couple". The iteration ends in the order B, A, C, D, E, F.

**** Second iteration
*Active couples remain active*, so A dances with C (the second couple) and D (the third couple). B is at the top and would like to become active, but there aren't any supporting couples. Note that C was the third couple last time and the second couple this time; supporting couples need to pay extra attention to which role they're dancing. The iteration ends in the order B, C, A, D, E, F.

**** Third iteration
*Active couples remain active*, so A dances with D (second couple) and E (third couple). B /still/ doesn't haven't enough supporting couples (C would be the second couple, but there's nobody to be the third). This ends in the order B, C, D, A, E, F.

**** Fourth iteration
Now we're off to the races. B finally has enough people to dance with, so they dance with C (second) and D (third). A continues dancing, now with E (second) and F (third). Note that the pattern of supporting couples alternating roles continues. D was the third, second, and now the third again. E was the third and is now the second. And so on and so forth. This iteration ends C, B, D, E, A, F.

**** Fifth iteration
Imagine that we had 26 couples, A through Z. A would keep working their way down the set as they have been, and every three times a new couple would become active (A was active starting the first time, B became active the fourth time, C will become active the seventh time, D the tenth, etc.). In the interest of expedience, though, I've made this set only have six couples, and the reason is so that we can talk about what A does at the bottom of the set. C is definitely out, and B is dancing with D and E, leaving A and F together at the bottom. There are two choices.

1. Traditionally[fn::I'm still looking for real evidence], A would dance with F and an imaginary couple. The third couple's part usually isn't very involved, so A and F can do what's expected even without real people dancing the third part. Modern people would say that ``the threes are ghosts" or ``the first and second couple dance with ghosts". This is more fun for A and F and has the helpful property of progressing them (they end in the order F-A), but depending on the dance can sometimes be a little confusing.
2. Another option is for A and F to sit out /but progress anyway/. That is, they don't dance, but exchange places by walking. This is neither as fun nor as elegant, but can be a nice breather.

Regardless, at the end of the fifth iteration the order is C, D, B, E, F, A.

**** More iterations

| At the start of the ___ iteration  | The order is:                |
|----------------------------------+------------------------------|
| 6th                              | C, D, [B, E, F], A           |
| 7th                              | [C, D, E], [B, F, A]         |
| 8th                              | D, [C, E, F], [B, A, ghosts] |
| 9th                              | D, E, [C, F, A], B           |
| 10th                             | [D, E, F], [C, A, B]         |
/Note that since A sat out at the bottom the sixth time through, they become a supporting couple the seventh time through/.

And so on and so forth. The dance continues until the music stops! It takes longer to become an active couple in triple minors (since a new couple is activated every three times instead of every other time), so be prepared for them to be run more times to compensate.

*** Conclusion

Progression can be intimidating since it feels like math, but rest assured that it becomes intuitive. For very inexperienced dancers, it can be helpful to warm them up to it:

1. Start by forming sets and then talking it through while people walk into the appropriate spots: "This is the first time through, so Adam and Abe are dancing with Betsy and Beth. They finish having switched places, and now Adam and Abe are ready to dance with Charles and Christina…"
2. Have everyone dance a /very/ short and simple dance (I like to use something like "1C and 2C dance 4H round and back; 1C turn by the right and cast into second place") so that the focus is on getting a lot of progression in, not figuring out difficult figures.
3. Graduate to a "real" dance that starts and ends with very forgiving figures so that dancers have time to scramble into the right spot.
4. Be ready to coordinate with the music to take little pauses between iterations while people figure out where they need to go.

* Common Figures
If footwork is about how to do something, figures are about where to go in the first place: they refer to the motion of dancers over the floor and through time, and as such have a /path/ and a /duration/. Some involve only moving a few feet (or moving in place), others require going halfway across the room. Some are for an individual dancer, others for a couple, and others for larger groups of dancers. A country dance is primarily identified by its sequence of figures; the footwork is more ornamental than substantive. And one of the most difficult activities for a historical dancer is translating printed dance instructions (a sequence of figures) into coherent motion.

Since figures are the heart of country dancing, it should come as no surprise both that there are many of them and that in an age before mass standardization the same terms meant different things to different people. Dance instructions tend to be terse, so the art of reconstruction is to take the explanations of figures in treatises and apply them to dances found in other books. This is rarely as straightforward as it sounds, but since it is an art you should expect to use your own creativity to fudge things enough to make it work.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Before figuring out how to fit figures together, we should go over some basic ones. Rather than attempt an exhaustive list, I've chosen to explain all of the figures found in [Cantelo], so that you can dance the dances he collected.

Bolded terms have their own entry.

** Allemande
TODO (Cantelo, 1: allemande round to the right)
** Cast off[fn::AD, 37-38]
Usually two bars, sometimes stretched to four.

Turn /up/, and continue turning until you're facing outside (so, a 180° turn). Dance a half-loop to end up in the place beneath you. It will feel like you took the long way around, which is correct.

If that space is filled by someone, they need to get out of the way by *stepping up* (which I've never seen explicitly mentioned).

Sometimes the indication is to ``cast off two couples", in which case the half-loop should end two places beneath you (and the two people below you would *step up*).

Sometimes called ``casting down", but ``off" is more common.

** Cast up[fn::AD, 38]
Identical to *casting off*, except going up instead of down.

** Cross [by the right/left]
Two bars, sometimes one. Two people facing each other.

Take hands (right hands unless told otherwise) and exchange places, traveling around each other in a graceful semicircle.

** Ditto (D°)
Not a real figure—just an indication that the previous figure should be repeated (probably with different people, as indicated).

** Foot It
Set (see above), for two, four, eight, or more bars. If setting ``to" someone, face them. If next to someone who is also setting, you may wish to take hands with them.

** Gallop[fn::AD, 18-19]
The figure is obscure, but I suggest reading it as *lead* but using a galloping step instead of a more usual traveling step. ``Gallop down two Couple, up again, and cast off"[fn::Cantelo, 1] means that the first couple takes hands, gallops down the center of the set until they're betwen the third couple, turns around, gallops back up the center of the set until they're at the top, and then *casts off* into second place.

The galloping step involves facing your partner, joining both hands, and slipping sideways

** Go The Compleat Round[fn:: c.f. [Cantelo, 4]]
*Hands round* for all dancers.

** [Three/Four] Hands Across [to the Left/Right] [and back][fn::AD, 42]
Three or four people; each direction is four bars.

Everyone takes the specified hand (forming a sort of star shape) and moves in a circle, ending where they began.  If "and back" is specified, go in one direction for four bars (whether it's a full revolution or not), then turn around and retrace your steps the other way for another four bars.

For four hands across, it's elegant to take a shake-hands grip with the person diagonally across from you and then have the two handshakes (four hands) rest on top of each other. It is definitely not elegant to have a jumbled mass of four hands, but sometimes it happens.

** Hands Round
See *Turn…Hands Round*.

** Half-hey
*Hey*, but only do half of it. Note that the outside two people will end up trading places and the middle person will end up back in the middle.

** Hey (for three)[fn::AD, 26-27]
Three dancers, usually eight bars. The dancers should be in a line with two facing each other and the third facing the back of the middle dancer.

The short story is that all three people dance interlocking figure-8s. I don't think pontificating on the mechanics at length is worthwile—it's the sort of thing that needs to be done to be understood. I'm sure you can find a demo on YouTube.

I have yet to see an explicit reference to a ``left-shoulder hey"; the assumption seems to be right-shoulder ones.

It's worth noting that heys could take place across the set, up and down the set, or along a diagonal line.

Everyone should end up where they started.

** Hey (for four)
Four dancers, eight bars.

Interlocking figure-8s, but for four people in a line (the first two facing each other, the last two facing each other, and therefore the middle two back-to-back). Apart from the headcount, comparable to a *hey for three*.

** Lead Down/Up[fn::AD, 38]
Almost any number of bars. Two people.

Take near hands and dance down/ up the center line. When leading down and up sequentially, switch hands when you turn around, so that near hands are always held[fn::Modern dancers usually keep right hand in right and don't release while turning around].

** Lead Outsides[fn::AD, 47]
Three couples, eight bars. Active couple in the center, others in corner positions as fenceposts.

The active couple start facing the men's sideline from the center of the set, with the woman above the man, and take near hands (man's right and woman's left). To get into this position you might need to fudge the previous figure a little bit.

They dance out the men's sideline, release hands, dance around the corner they're closest to (man around the third man, woman around the second man), meet in the center (having re-entered from the top or bottom of the set), face out the women's sideline, take hands (woman's right in man's left) and repeat the process with the women (man around the third woman, woman woman around the second woman). They end in the center of the set.
** Right[s] and Left[s][fn::AD, 25-26]
Four or eight bars (very fast when it's done in four), for two couples.

The golden rule of rights and lefts is that everyone moves in a circle starting in the direction they're facing. So the first man and second woman go clockwise and the first woman and second man go counter-clockwise.

Specifically, each couple *crosses by the right*, turns 90° to face their neighbor, *crosses by the /left/* with their neighbor, turns 90° to face their partner, and repeats the process (another cross by the right, another cross by the left) to end up back in place.

A common mistake is to turn 270°. This sounds ridiculous on paper, but it's startling how many people do it in real life. It's best if peple think of it as traveling in a circle, assisted by taking hands with someone every quarter-circle.

It's especially easy to do rude things with your arms, so be careful.
** Set Cross Corners and Turn[fn::I believe this is the same figure as ``Foot Contrary Corners, and Turn'' described in [AD, 32]]
Eight bars. Three couples, with the active couple in the center of the set facing their corners.

The active couple takes right hands with the corner they're facing, and then turns them. The corners end where they started and the active couple ends facing their second corners, which they also set to and turn. The active couple ends in the center of the set unless otherwise indicated.

In some sources[fn::e.g. [Cantelo, 3]], only the first half of the above is meant (which is a moot point since Cantelo follows it up with a ``Ditto" to get the second half).
** Step Up
Not a period term, as far as I know. Taking a few sidesteps until you end up one place higher (e.g., someone in second place could step up into first place). There are more and less elegant ways of doing the sidesteps, but don't worry about it.

** Turn
Two or four bars; two people.

Take hands (by default, right in right) and turn 360°. See below chapter on arms.

** Turn to Place
Two or four bars; two people.

Turn until you end in the correct place (which may be your starting place or may be your progressed place) on your own sideline. This may involve turning some weird number of degrees that's not an even number of half turns and it may involve different couples turning different amounts (e.g., if first couple were on opposite sides but second and third couples were proper, ``all turn to place" would mean that the first couple does a half turn and the second and third couples do a full turn). You're allowed to add full turns as time allows—in the previous example the first couple may have seen fit to do a turn and a half instead of just a half turn.
** [Turn] Three/Four/Six/Eight Hands [the] Round[fn::AD, 42-43, 50]
The requisite number of people take hands in a circle and move (by slip stepping) in the direction indicated. If no direction is specified, assume it's to the right (counter-clockwise). End where you started.

Note that the number refers to people, not literal hands: "three hands round" involves three people holding their /six/ hands together.


* Your Arms
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I cannot but deplore the disgraceful neglect that is so apparent in most dancers with regard
to the proper use of their arms, as surely this is of as much consequence as the management
of their legs; since…the use of the one is fully as necessary as that of the other. Even in walking,
what a ridiculous figure the person must display who disregards that regular counter-motion which
whould ever be maintained by the arms and legs!

—Barclay Dun[fn::Dun, 20-21]
#+END_QUOTE
It's easy to focus on where you're going and how you get there—figures and progression and such. And even once you're mostly on top of it, there's a temptation to refine footwork. This attitude is not misplaced, but one mustn't forget one's arms, either.

A few general notes on etiquette and decorum:

1. *Never ever ever* hurt another dancer by grabbing them too tightly, twisting their arm, straining their shoulder, or doing anything similar. If you're not sure if something is going to hurt, /don't do it/. If you are being hurt, speak up.
2. Even with the best intentions, sometimes people hold on for too long. If someone is trying to release their hand from your grip (say, because they're trying to get in position for the next figure), let them go! For whatever reason, it's particularly common for people to hold on too long while doing rights and lefts.
3. I can't think of a time where you should lock elbows. Even with ``straight" arms, give your elbows a slight bend. It's better for them orthopedically, and the curve is more aesthetic.[fn::[Dun, 28] compares the curve of the hey figure with Hogarth's Line of Beauty, and that same S-shaped curve can frequently be formed by two arms]
4. When giving your hand to someone—or receiving someone else's hand—make eye contact with them[fn::Dun, 28]!

There are a couple different ways of taking hands (c.f. [AD 16]), but for now focus on what's call the ``shake-hands grip", which is a slight misnomer. It's achieved by almost shaking hands with someone, but instead of touching palm and palm, touch fingers and fingers. It should feel like your four fingers are hooked around their four fingers and you're both slightly pulling on each other. This has several benefits, notably:

1. It looks good.
2. It's easy to get into.
3. It's easy to get out of.
4. It allows for some tension—when turning, it's best to lean back and let your partner counterbalance some of your weight.

Try to avoid the bro handshake thing of hooking thumb and thumb. Certainly avoid interlacing fingers.

* Of the Music
A lot could be said about music, but this is a dance manual, not a music manual, so I'm going to assume you have access to a reasonable dance musician. There are a couple things dancers—and especially dance teachers—should be aware of though.

** Tune Types

 - *Reels:* The most common. In 2/2.
 - *Jigs:* The same general idea as reels (same speed, traveling step, etc.), but in 6/8. Some people struggle to hear the difference between 2/2 (notes in groups of two or four) and 6/8 (notes in groups of three).
 - *9/8 Jigs:* Also called *slip jigs*, especially by the Irish. Jigs, but in 9/8 (three groups of three) instead of 6/8. See earlier commentary about dancing in three instead of in two. You'd count a 6/8 jig ``one and two and" and a 9/8 jig ``one and a two and a" (or ``one two three one two three").
 - *3/2 Hornpipes:* To round out the mathematical possibilities, these are in three (like 9/8 jigs) but have notes in groups of two or four (like reels). Count them ``one and two and three and". They dramatically faded in popularity at the end of the 18th century (the same time that 4/4 hornpipes started getting trendy), but that's a topic for another day.
 - *Waltzes:* In three. I'm sure you've heard a waltz before.
 - *Country Dance Tunes:* Especially with English dancing, and /especially/ if someone is sneaking in Playford dances[fn::They shouldn't be!], you might get tunes that are their own thing and don't really fit one of the above categories. That's okay. Just listen for the beat and figure out if it's in two or three.
 - *Other Tunes:* I'm deliberately avoiding discussion of more niche options, like 4/4 hornpipes, minuets and other Continental court dances, and so forth. If you have a minuet-shaped problem in your life, you're already too cool for this book.

Some people struggle to hear the difference between reels and jigs. The rule of thumb is that if you can fit in a lot of four-syllable words/phrases that start stressed (the classic is ``alligator", perhaps a more obvious one is ``reel-y reel-y")  singing along with the tune it's a reel. If you can fit in a lot of three-syllable ones (``jiggity jiggity" is the classic) it's a jig. Note that the waters get muddied by tunes having a mix of eigth notes and quarter notes, so you might have to throw in a few filler words. See the figure for some examples.

** Counting
It's obviously important to know how much dancing is supposed to go along with how much music, and the key to figuring it out is counting. Some people count by bars and some by ``steps" (beats), which is the same idea but twice or thrice as much work (depending on if the tune is in two or three). It doesn't matter, but I like to use bars and will do so here.

The first step in counting by bars is to train your ear to hear them. A useful exercise (assuming someone present knows what they're doing) is to go through each tune type and have participants:

1. Tap their foot on the beat.
2. Tap their foot on the first beat of each bar and clap on the remaining beat(s) of each bar.
3. Tap their foot only on the first beat of every fourth bar (the first, the fifth, etc.).
4. Tap their foot only on the first beat of every eighth bar (the first, the ninth, etc.).
5. Form sets and have each couple take turns dancing down the middle and back, being sure to time their turnaround well. Have them try going down for two, four, and eight bars.

With the basics established, it's dependent on the dancing master to ensure figures are being done for an appropriate number of bars. At the very least, the dancing master should know how many bars each figure is supposed to take, and coordinate with the musician to make sure things are happening on time.
